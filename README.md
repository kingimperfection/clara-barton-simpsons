# Return of Homer Simpson's Profile!

- Under Homer's interests, fill in the correct link to the nuclear.html page.
- The page for Moe's Tavern has a broken image. Fix it! (Hint: check the img src on the nuclear.html page)
- Change the fonts. Play around with size, color, and the font family!
- Change the background color of the header (where it says "Homer Simpson").
- Pick another Simpsons character to add to Homer's Wall. Include a picture, a quote, and an alert that pops up when the picture is clicked.
- Maggie Simpson can't talk, so we aren't putting an `alert` here. Add some jQuery to switch her picture to something else when it's clicked.
- Add CSS that changes the background color of each item on Homer's Wall as you hover over it.
- Add a jQuery click handler to the donuts button so that *every* image on the page is changed the same picture of donuts when the button is clicked.
- Add a new html page for "Springfield", and update Homer's interests to link to that page.
